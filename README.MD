# Spanish Encoding Fixer

Ever wrestled with mangled Spanish text in JSON files? You know, when your beautiful "m√°s all√°" turns into a
horrifying "m√É¬°s all√É¬°"? Yeah, we've all been there. This tool is your knight in shining armor for those encoding
nightmares.

## Features

- **Async Processing**: Because life's too short to wait for sequential file processing
- **Robust Error Handling**: With retries that would make a persistence hunter proud
- **Automatic Backups**: Because we're paranoid (in a good way)
- **Detailed Logging**: Know exactly what's happening, when, and where
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models keeping everything in check
- **Progress Tracking**: Watch those files get fixed in real-time
- **Comprehensive Validation**: No encoding issue escapes our notice

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Python 3.8+ required
pip install pydantic tenacity
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from src.spanish_encoding_fixer import SpanishEncodingFixer


async def main():
    fixer = SpanishEncodingFixer(
        input_dir="path/to/your/files",
        backup=True,
        max_retries=3
    )
    stats = await fixer.process_directory()
    print(f"Processing completed in {stats.duration:.2f} seconds")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## üîç How It Works

The fixer employs a battle-tested strategy to handle common Spanish encoding issues:

1. **Detection**: Identifies problematic character sequences
2. **Transformation**: Applies carefully mapped character replacements
3. **Validation**: Verifies the results to ensure quality
4. **Backup**: Keeps your original files safe
5. **Reporting**: Provides detailed statistics and logs

## üìä Processing Stats

Get comprehensive statistics about your processing run:

```python
ProcessingStats(
    processed=42,  # Successfully processed files
    failed=0,  # Failed files
    skipped=2,  # Skipped files
    total_chars_processed=123456,  # Total characters fixed
    duration=3.14  # Processing time in seconds
)
```

## üõ† Advanced Usage

### Custom Replacement Mappings

```python
fixer = SpanishEncodingFixer(
    input_dir="data",
    replacements={
        '√É¬°': '√°',
        '√É¬©': '√©',
        # Add your own mappings
    }
)
```

### Error Handling Configuration

```python
from tenacity import stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential

fixer = SpanishEncodingFixer(
    input_dir="data",
    retry_config={
        "stop": stop_after_attempt(5),
        "wait": wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10)
    }
)
```

## üìù Logging

The tool provides detailed logging with rotation:

```plaintext
2024-12-11 00:41:57,115 - INFO - [main.py:182] - Processing file: data/example.json
2024-12-11 00:41:57,116 - INFO - [main.py:223] - Successfully processed: example.json
```
